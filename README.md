### Potluck

Potluck is an answer to the age-old question: "What should we have for dinner tonight?". Users can post their favorite recipes, browse other users' recipes, search for a specific recipe, and get a random recipe from the database. Potluck then displays the ingredients required and necessary instructions in a mobile-friendly view perfect for planning dinner on the train ride home.

## How it works
After creating an account and logging in, users can navigate a menu of options for finding and posting recipes. The application relies on users to add their favorite recipes to the database so everyone can enjoy (just like a real potluck!). If you're having trouble deciding from the plethora of options, try your (Pot)luck with Recipe Roulette! Each time the button is clicked, a random recipe will be returned, so you don't have the tough decisions. In future releases, this will become even more customizable, with options for requiring ingredients, excluding ingredients, and even finding a recipe you can make with the food in your pantry!
